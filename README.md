# Insect Pest Recognition and Classification

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the development of a machine learning model to accurately recognize different insect pest species under varying environmental conditions. The model extends its capabilities to classify the maturity stages of identified insect pests, ranging from eggs to fully mature adults. To make this technology accessible and user-friendly, a mobile application or web platform will be created, enabling agricultural experts to capture pest images in real-time. This initiative aims to promote sustainable agriculture by reducing the reliance on chemical pesticides and minimizing crop damage.
